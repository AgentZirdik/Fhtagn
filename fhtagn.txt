Narrator (N): Welcome to Fhtagn Corp. We'll be walking you through your job here today. As a community manager, it's your job to find the truly crazy comments among the ones that just look crazy! Ha ha, people are sometimes so strange.

N: Why don't you try. Here's a random sampling of comments from a youtube video. Just go ahead and select the comment by a worshipper of The Dark One.

1) asdfxjck : what the fuck is the seventies, some kind of cheese candie ? ? ? ?
2) JOHNJONH : oBOMBa IS A TERRORIST!!!!!!1
3) asianchkkkk : hey there boys messige me for a chat
*4) Cthulu Worshipper : Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn

----

N: Very good! I'm quite impressed. Nearly 80% of candidates for this position fail that question. It's a little more difficult sometimes when the Acolyte of the Unholy Terror speaks in code. Try again:

1) nontheistis : why isnt the sun the most dangerous place on earth
2) McGeeGeeGee : this music makes me want to kick my cat
*3) TheDarkOneComes : Can This Help U Life Underwater?
4) oppenhiem66 : i want to nuke india

----

N: Excellent! You could probably tell by the username, or the fact that the comment was an acrostic for "CTHULU". 

N: It looks like you're going to be a natural at this job. Why don't you go ahead and get started on the queue.
